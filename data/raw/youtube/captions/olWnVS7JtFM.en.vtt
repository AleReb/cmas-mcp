The idea for this project arose after

talking with an athlete with a

talking with an athlete with a

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
disability about how he

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
and what he had basically done was
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.609 align:start position:0%
and what he had basically done was
adapt <00:00:14.940><c>a </c><00:00:15.600><c>seat </c><00:00:16.260><c>that</c>

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
adapt a seat that
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 align:start position:0%
adapt a seat that
allowed <00:00:16.955><c>him </c><00:00:17.291><c>to </c><00:00:17.627><c>compete. </c><00:00:17.963><c>This </c><00:00:18.299><c>sparked</c>

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
allowed him to compete. This sparked
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.269 align:start position:0%
allowed him to compete. This sparked
our <00:00:19.215><c>interest </c><00:00:19.530><c>in </c><00:00:19.845><c>how </c><00:00:20.160><c>we</c>

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
our interest in how we
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.650 align:start position:0%
our interest in how we
could <00:00:20.519><c>support </c><00:00:20.759><c>him </c><00:00:20.999><c>so </c><00:00:21.239><c>he </c><00:00:21.479><c>could</c>

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
could support him so he could
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
could support him so he could
compete <00:00:22.155><c>better, </c><00:00:22.650><c>and </c><00:00:23.145><c>that's </c><00:00:23.640><c>how</c>

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
compete better, and that's how
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 align:start position:0%
compete better, and that's how
Sídex <00:00:24.216><c>came </c><00:00:24.552><c>about. </c><00:00:24.888><c>It </c><00:00:25.224><c>was </c><00:00:25.560><c>designed</c>

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
Sídex came about. It was designed
 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.950 align:start position:0%
Sídex came about. It was designed
so <00:00:26.082><c>that </c><00:00:26.364><c>people </c><00:00:26.646><c>with </c><00:00:26.928><c>limited </c><00:00:27.210><c>mobility </c><00:00:27.492><c>in </c><00:00:27.774><c>their</c>

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
so that people with limited mobility in their
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.810 align:start position:0%
so that people with limited mobility in their
lower <00:00:28.175><c>limbs </c><00:00:28.390><c>could </c><00:00:28.605><c>participate </c><00:00:28.820><c>in</c>

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
lower limbs could participate in
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 align:start position:0%
lower limbs could participate in
canoeing <00:00:31.500><c>activities,</c>

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
canoeing activities,
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.170 align:start position:0%
canoeing activities,
both <00:00:32.340><c>competitively </c><00:00:32.700><c>and</c>

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
both competitively and
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 align:start position:0%
both competitively and
recreationally. <00:00:33.648><c>During </c><00:00:34.116><c>the </c><00:00:34.584><c>design </c><00:00:35.052><c>of </c><00:00:35.520><c>Sídex,</c>

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
recreationally. During the design of Sídex,
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.370 align:start position:0%
recreationally. During the design of Sídex,
we <00:00:36.480><c>focused </c><00:00:37.140><c>on</c>

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
we focused on
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.049 align:start position:0%
we focused on
three <00:00:38.160><c>key </c><00:00:38.940><c>concepts:</c>

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
three key concepts:
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.889 align:start position:0%
three key concepts:
safety, <00:00:39.919><c>ergonomics, </c><00:00:40.779><c>and </c><00:00:41.639><c>movement.</c>

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 align:start position:0%
safety, ergonomics, and movement.
 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.869 align:start position:0%
safety, ergonomics, and movement.
The <00:00:42.471><c>latter </c><00:00:43.043><c>was </c><00:00:43.615><c>primarily </c><00:00:44.187><c>considered </c><00:00:44.759><c>for</c>

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:0%
The latter was primarily considered for
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.670 align:start position:0%
The latter was primarily considered for
athletes, <00:00:45.191><c>given </c><00:00:45.503><c>that </c><00:00:45.815><c>they </c><00:00:46.127><c>must </c><00:00:46.439><c>perform</c>

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
athletes, given that they must perform
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 align:start position:0%
athletes, given that they must perform
very <00:00:47.340><c>specific </c><00:00:48.000><c>movements</c>

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
very specific movements
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.069 align:start position:0%
very specific movements
while <00:00:49.346><c>paddling. </c><00:00:50.212><c>So </c><00:00:51.078><c>it's</c>

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
while paddling. So it's
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 align:start position:0%
while paddling. So it's
important, <00:00:52.484><c>and </c><00:00:52.889><c>we </c><00:00:53.294><c>made </c><00:00:53.699><c>sure</c>

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
important, and we made sure
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.569 align:start position:0%
important, and we made sure
that <00:00:54.280><c>both </c><00:00:54.620><c>the </c><00:00:54.960><c>seat </c><00:00:55.300><c>and </c><00:00:55.640><c>the </c><00:00:55.980><c>restraints</c>

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
that both the seat and the restraints
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.770 align:start position:0%
that both the seat and the restraints
allowed <00:00:56.771><c>them </c><00:00:56.963><c>to </c><00:00:57.155><c>perform </c><00:00:57.347><c>all </c><00:00:57.539><c>the</c>

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
allowed them to perform all the
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.729 align:start position:0%
allowed them to perform all the
maneuvers <00:00:58.110><c>they </c><00:00:58.440><c>need,</c>

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
maneuvers they need,
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 align:start position:0%
maneuvers they need,
understanding <00:00:59.379><c>that </c><00:01:00.019><c>the </c><00:01:00.659><c>movements</c>

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that the movements
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
understanding that the movements
can <00:01:01.090><c>be </c><00:01:01.340><c>different </c><00:01:01.590><c>depending </c><00:01:01.840><c>on </c><00:01:02.090><c>whether </c><00:01:02.340><c>they</c>

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
can be different depending on whether they
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
can be different depending on whether they
are <00:01:05.460><c>rafting,</c>

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
are rafting,
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910 align:start position:0%
are rafting,
kayaking, <00:01:06.345><c>or </c><00:01:06.690><c>canoeing. </c><00:01:07.035><c>Therefore, </c><00:01:07.380><c>our</c>

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
kayaking, or canoeing. Therefore, our
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.710 align:start position:0%
kayaking, or canoeing. Therefore, our
design <00:01:08.231><c>had </c><00:01:08.542><c>to </c><00:01:08.853><c>take </c><00:01:09.164><c>all </c><00:01:09.475><c>these</c>

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
design had to take all these
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.890 align:start position:0%
design had to take all these
particularities into account.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 align:start position:0%
particularities into account.
 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.229 align:start position:0%
particularities into account.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.150 align:start position:0%

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
was working.
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 align:start position:0%
was working.
Well, <00:00:38.533><c>patients </c><00:00:38.906><c>in </c><00:00:39.279><c>the</c>

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
Well, patients in the
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 align:start position:0%
Well, patients in the
ward <00:00:40.060><c>have </c><00:00:40.520><c>many </c><00:00:40.980><c>problems, </c><00:00:41.440><c>and</c>

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
ward have many problems, and
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.229 align:start position:0%
ward have many problems, and
one <00:00:41.890><c>of </c><00:00:42.140><c>them </c><00:00:42.390><c>is </c><00:00:42.640><c>that </c><00:00:42.890><c>they </c><00:00:43.140><c>have </c><00:00:43.390><c>drains </c><00:00:43.640><c>that</c>

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
one of them is that they have drains that
 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
one of them is that they have drains that
come <00:00:44.539><c>loose, </c><00:00:44.839><c>so </c><00:00:45.139><c>the </c><00:00:45.439><c>probability</c>

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
come loose, so the probability
 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.510 align:start position:0%
come loose, so the probability
of <00:00:46.128><c>them </c><00:00:46.496><c>detaching </c><00:00:46.864><c>is </c><00:00:47.232><c>very </c><00:00:47.600><c>high.</c>

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
of them detaching is very high.
 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.790 align:start position:0%
of them detaching is very high.
So, <00:00:48.691><c>more </c><00:00:48.862><c>than </c><00:00:49.033><c>anything </c><00:00:49.204><c>we </c><00:00:49.375><c>want </c><00:00:49.546><c>a </c><00:00:49.717><c>small</c>

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
So, more than anything we want a small
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.590 align:start position:0%
So, more than anything we want a small
bag <00:00:49.923><c>that </c><00:00:50.046><c>can </c><00:00:50.169><c>be </c><00:00:50.292><c>hung </c><00:00:50.415><c>as </c><00:00:50.538><c>a </c><00:00:50.661><c>purse </c><00:00:50.784><c>as </c><00:00:50.907><c>well </c><00:00:51.030><c>as </c><00:00:51.153><c>a</c>

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
see what they are spending on.  We saw
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.430 align:start position:0%
see what they are spending on.  We saw
that <00:00:59.434><c>SMEs </c><00:00:59.548><c>in </c><00:00:59.662><c>general </c><00:00:59.776><c>didn't </c><00:00:59.890><c>know </c><00:01:00.004><c>how </c><00:01:00.118><c>to</c>

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
that SMEs in general didn't know how to
 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.630 align:start position:0%
that SMEs in general didn't know how to
manage <00:01:00.691><c>their </c><00:01:00.942><c>costs </c><00:01:01.193><c>very </c><00:01:01.444><c>well, </c><00:01:01.695><c>mostly </c><00:01:01.946><c>due </c><00:01:02.197><c>to</c>

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
manage their costs very well, mostly due to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
personal experiences,
 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
personal experiences,
so <00:01:04.496><c>we </c><00:01:04.753><c>made </c><00:01:05.010><c>a </c><00:01:05.267><c>change </c><00:01:05.524><c>there </c><00:01:05.781><c>and </c><00:01:06.038><c>were</c>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we made a change there and were
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
so we made a change there and were
able <00:01:06.520><c>to </c><00:01:06.800><c>enter </c><00:01:07.080><c>that </c><00:01:07.360><c>market </c><00:01:07.640><c>and</c>

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
able to enter that market and
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.469 align:start position:0%
able to enter that market and
really <00:01:08.028><c>make </c><00:01:08.216><c>it </c><00:01:08.404><c>so </c><00:01:08.592><c>that </c><00:01:08.780><c>SMEs </c><00:01:08.968><c>don't </c><00:01:09.156><c>spend</c>

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
really make it so that SMEs don't spend
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.270 align:start position:0%
really make it so that SMEs don't spend
more <00:01:09.815><c>resources </c><00:01:10.151><c>on </c><00:01:10.487><c>things </c><00:01:10.823><c>they </c><00:01:11.159><c>shouldn't.</c>

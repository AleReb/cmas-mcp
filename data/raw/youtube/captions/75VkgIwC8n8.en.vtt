This <00:00:23.940><c>device </c><00:00:24.720><c>is</c>

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
This device is
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.750 align:start position:0%
This device is
flexible <00:00:26.460><c>and</c>

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
flexible and
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.890 align:start position:0%
flexible and
also <00:00:26.940><c>has </c><00:00:27.120><c>a </c><00:00:27.300><c>rigid </c><00:00:27.480><c>element </c><00:00:27.660><c>inside,</c>

also has a rigid element inside,
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.330 align:start position:0%
also has a rigid element inside,
like <00:00:28.560><c>a </c><00:00:29.220><c>bone,</c>

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
like a bone,
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
like a bone,
so <00:00:29.719><c>we </c><00:00:30.098><c>get </c><00:00:30.477><c>quite </c><00:00:30.856><c>close </c><00:00:31.235><c>to </c><00:00:31.614><c>a</c>

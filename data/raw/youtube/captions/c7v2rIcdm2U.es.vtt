00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.111
The general objective of the project is to measure the

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:15.215
“vital signs” of well-being of the rivers that are part of the Maipo valley watershed.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.051
This is why we are taking measurements in 5 different

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:21.021
locations of the river network, thus allowing us

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.556
to compare measurements of these vital

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:27.994
signs that are related to the quality of the water.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.964
People that live on the banks of the river can approach us

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:35.602
and start to understand how changeable and vulnerable our rivers are.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.670
We are often not aware of what may

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.073
end up being added to our rivers and where this may happen.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.276
When we can note that one of the parameters

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.246
related to pollution has suddenly changed between one measurement point and the next,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.815
then we can gauge where pollution is entering the river system.

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.218
Our purpose is to create a baseline, so as to know

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:59.092
the levels of chlorine, nitrates, temperature, salinity, whether

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:03.363
there is a presence of pesticides and coliform bacteria and

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:09.836
therefore we can have a baseline for detecting future changes.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.606
These changes that could be related to natural changes that are

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.576
related to climate change or they could be

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:21.047
caused by human activities such as, for example,

00:01:21.047 --> 00:01:26.719
mining activities in this area, which could all affect water quality.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.223
It is important because this river sustains

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:34.527
life in this valley as well as providing the

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.529
drinking water for the city of Santiago.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.032
We have now experienced 12 years of drought in the area,

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.669
reducing the quantity of water in the river Maipo by over 30%

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:49.409
and its capacity to clean the pollutants, minerals and sediments becomes more difficult.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.147
There is a strong feedback from the local volunteers

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:58.384
in this project and we can start a

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:02.188
conversation about what we are measuring.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.525
The data that we are creating, in the form of numbers

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.062
needs to be interpreted and thanks to this vital local knowledge,

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.898
the data becomes much more real and relevant

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.934
rather than a supposition of what is happening.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.204
This is the strength of Citizen science,

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:22.842
that local people who are are taking the measurements 

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.478
are also participating in a dialogue related to the interpretation of the data.

This is a project that arose a

couple of years ago from our concern
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago from our concern

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
about how a bathtub
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.589 align:start position:0%
about how a bathtub
could <00:00:13.332><c>be </c><00:00:13.704><c>used </c><00:00:14.076><c>by </c><00:00:14.448><c>people </c><00:00:14.820><c>with</c>

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
could be used by people with
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.930 align:start position:0%
could be used by people with

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.510 align:start position:0%
same family.
So <00:00:19.140><c>we </c><00:00:19.380><c>thought, </c><00:00:19.620><c>for </c><00:00:19.860><c>example, </c><00:00:20.100><c>someone </c><00:00:20.340><c>with</c>

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.010 align:start position:0%
So we thought, for example, someone with

to bathe children. For example,

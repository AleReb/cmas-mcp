00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
the good thing about the project is that there is a
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 align:start position:0%
the good thing about the project is that there is a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
basically developed together with the
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.730 align:start position:0%
basically developed together with the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
end users. Therefore, what we
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 align:start position:0%
end users. Therefore, what we
want <00:01:17.100><c>with </c><00:01:17.460><c>that </c><00:01:17.820><c>is </c><00:01:18.180><c>to </c><00:01:18.540><c>obtain</c>

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
want with that is to obtain
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.770 align:start position:0%
want with that is to obtain
much <00:01:19.665><c>more </c><00:01:20.310><c>specific, </c><00:01:20.955><c>much </c><00:01:21.600><c>better</c>

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
much more specific, much better
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 align:start position:0%
much more specific, much better

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.950 align:start position:0%
work together, on future applications.
For <00:01:35.989><c>example, </c><00:01:36.578><c>we </c><00:01:37.167><c>addressed </c><00:01:37.756><c>seven</c>

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
For example, we addressed seven
 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.330 align:start position:0%
For example, we addressed seven

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 align:start position:0%
specific problems in depth, for which
we <00:01:41.790><c>developed </c><00:01:42.240><c>seven</c>

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
we developed seven
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.350 align:start position:0%
we developed seven

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
specific technological solutions, but
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 align:start position:0%
specific technological solutions, but
many <00:01:45.531><c>remained </c><00:01:45.702><c>pending. </c><00:01:45.873><c>So </c><00:01:46.044><c>the </c><00:01:46.215><c>idea </c><00:01:46.386><c>is </c><00:01:46.557><c>to</c>
